          Whyï¼Ÿ
        </h2>
      <p>We wrote an article before <a target="_blank" href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/45121775">Does Angular need state management?</a>, Under the Angular framework, the state of front-end application can be easily managed through the <code>Service</code> and <code>Observable,</code> but <code>RxJS</code> is too abstract and difficult to learn, which makes it difficult for some developers to control <code>RxJS</code> and easy modify the state directly in components. In order to restrict the behavior of developers and provide a unified API to simplify business operations, we have encapsulated a small state management class library, It allows ordinary developers to manage the state well.</p>
